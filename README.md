<i>Quick and dirty implementation of kafka, mapreduce, twitter4j to produce Summary tweet per trend.</i><br> This is done by keying each tweet with its sentiment value.<br>
A mean is extracted per trend from these values and the tweet with the minimum variance is produced. This tweet basically says something sentiment-wise that a majority of tweets say ie it is a base opinion.
